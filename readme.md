An extension that lets you create interactive scenarios with variables and basic scripting.

## What it does
- Create scenarios with custom questions
- Use variables in the description/first message/personality/scenario/character note.
- Add simple scripts to make things dynamic. (JavaScript)
- Import/export scenarios as JSON/PNG

## Question types
- Text input
- Dropdown select
- Checkbox

## How to use

## Simple scripting
You can write basic JavaScript to manipulate variables. For example:

If your description is:
```
{{user}} just received a package with a gift from an unknown sender. The package is labeled as containing {{gift}}.

You also received a card with the following message: {{occasionMessage}}
```

Assume this was the answer to the question:
```yml
gift: "a book"
message: "birthday"
# As you see, there is no `occasionMessage`
```

You can write a script for setting `occasionMessage`
```js
variables.occasionMessage = `Happy {{message}}! Enjoy your new {{gift}}`;
```

Or:
```js
variables.occasionMessage = `Happy ${variables.message}! Enjoy your new ${variables.gift}`;
```

Or:
```js
variables.occasionMessage = "Happy " + variables.message + "! Enjoy your new " + variables.gift;
```

Output will be:
```
{{user}} just received a package with a gift from an unknown sender. The package is labeled as containing a book.

You also received a card with the following message: Happy birthday! Enjoy your new book
```

## Scripting Details
* `variables` is an object that holds all the variables. Aka the answers to the questions.
* All variables can be accessed and modified.
* Example usage: (Let's say question id is `gift`)
    * If question type is _text_, `variables.gift`
    * If the question type is _dropdown_, `variables.gift.value` and `variables.gift.label`. When creating the card, `variables.gift.label` is used.
    * If question type is _checkbox_, `variables.gift`. (boolean)
* `Show Script` is a script that decides whether to show the question or not in the play dialog. Example:  `return variables.gift === "birthday"` will show the question only if the answer is "birthday".
* In preview, empty strings are showing as `{{variable}}` but in the created card, they are not shown.
* We can get single lorebook entry by `await world.getFirst({name?: string, keyword: string})`. Example usage:
```js
const info = await world.getFirst({keyword: "triggerWord"}); // name is optional, default name is character lorebook
if (info) {
    variables.f_companion_content = info.content;
}
```
* We can get all lorebook entries by `await world.getAll({name?: string, keyword: string})`. Example usage:
```js
const infos = await world.getAll({keyword: "triggerWord"}); // name is optional, default name is character lorebook
if (infos && infos.length > 0) {
    variables.f_companion_content = infos[0].content;
}
```


## FAQ:
### Why did you create this?
I saw this on [AIDungeon](https://play.aidungeon.com/) and liked it. You can see in this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SillyTavernAI/comments/1i59jem/scenario_system_similar_to_ai_dungeon_nsfw_for/) with an example.

### Why version is _0.4.1_
It is because of UI, not functionality.

## Known Issues
* Tags are not importing to SillyTavern because I don't want to show `Import Tags` dialog for each play. So I'm planning to add a extension setting to enable/disable this.
